# Homework 1: Python Code Challenges

---
## Due Date
This assignment is due before midnight on Friday, January 22.


## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starter Code | Required questions and Bonus prompts | [Here](./project-1-problem-set.ipynb) |


## Project Objective

We've provided a Jupyter notebook that contains the kinds of coding challenges that often come up in data science job interviews. In addition to preparing you for interviews, completing challenges like these is a fun way to develop your Python skills.

Some of these problems are well known, so it may be possible to find complete solutions online. Students should see these questions as an opportunity to challenge themselves; looking up answers limits the potential growth that comes from practice and repetition of these skills.

## Project Requirements


Your solutions should include:

1. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
2. Comments when appropriate.
   - Comments are used to explain code that may not be immediately obvious.
3. **Optional**: After completing the required portions, try your hand at the **bonus** sections for some additional challenges!
