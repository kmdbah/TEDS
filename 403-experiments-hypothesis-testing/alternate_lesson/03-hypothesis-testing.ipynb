    "Generally speaking, we start with a **null hypothesis** and an **alternative hypothesis**, which is the opposite of the null. Then, you check whether the data support rejecting your null hypothesis or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null hypothesis**: There is no relationship between gender and sales.\n",
    "- **Alternative hypothesis**: There is a relationship between gender and sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that \"failing to reject\" the null hypothesis is not the same as \"accepting\" it. Your alternative hypothesis may indeed be true, but you don't necessarily have enough data to show that yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction is important for helping you avoid overstating your findings. You should only state what your data and analysis can truly represent."

    "#### How Do We Tell if the Association We Observed is Statistically Significant?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical significance** is whether or not a result or relationship is caused by something other than mere random chance. Statistical hypothesis testing is traditionally employed to determine whether or not a result is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might ask: **How likely is the effect observed to be true, assuming the null hypothesis is true?** If the probability of our observation occurring by chance is less than 5 percent (supposing the null hypothesis), then we reject the null hypothesis. _(Note that the 5 percent value is in many ways arbitrary)._\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of our observations occurring by chance, given the null hypothesis, is the **p-value** ($p$).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Suppose you flip a coin three times and get three heads in a row. These three flips are our observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We want to know whether or not the coin is fair. So, we select the **null hypothesis:**\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$H_0: \\text{The coin is fair.}$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "+ Now, let's suppose the null hypothesis is true. Three heads in a row occurs with a chance of $1/2^3 \\approx 12.5\\%$.\n",
    "+ Because there is a reasonable ($> 5\\%$) chance of three heads occuring naturally, we do not reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "+ So, **we conclude** that we do not have enough data to tell whether or not the coin is fair ($p = 0.125$).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we say that something is NOT statistically significant if there is a less than 5 percent chance that our finding was caused by chance alone (assuming the null hypothesis is true)."

    "\n",
    "Hopefully the logic shines through here:\n",
    "- 3 heads in a row isn't rare. It can happen.\n",
    "- 10 heads in a row is extremely unlikely. I'd believe the coin was unfair."

We have no firm knowledge, however, that our single estimate of the \"true\" effect/difference is close or not to the \"truth\". The confidence interval around our estimate tells us, with a given sample size and level of confidence, the range in which future estimates are likely to fall.\n",
