# Capstone Project

---

## Project Objective(s)

#### Description
Our final project asks you to apply your skills to a business problem of your choice. The capstone is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your new skills and tackle a pressing issue relevant to your team, division, or organization. Youâ€™ll generate a hypothesis, analyze internal data, and generate a working model, prototype, solution, or recommendation.

#### Deliverables
You will get structured guidance and designated time to work throughout the course. Final project deliverables include:

- **Part 1: Project Proposal/Data**: Select a data set and fill out the notebook provided in this repository. The goal of this portion is to get approval from the instructional team for your data. If you have any questions regarding the viability of your data, please reach out. If the team decides your dataset is outside the bounds of a sensible capstone, you will need to redo this part. See the included notebook for what a good data set looks like.
- **Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Share a summary of your initial analysis. Notebook should contain a thorough analysis and description of your data as well as relevant graphics. The goal is that the reader underderstands the shape and nature of the data you are working with. 
- **Part 3: Modeling/Results**: Submit a cleanly formatted Jupyter notebook (or other files) documenting your code, processes, model, and results. The format of this notebook should resemble a medium-length memo.
- **Part 4: Presentation**: Present a summary of your business problem, approach, and recommendation to an audience of non-technical executive stakeholders.

Your project is meant to resemble an actual client deliverable. Your audience is a client. Parts 2 and 3 should be clean notebooks that you would feel comfortable presenting to a client. Part 4, the presentation, should resemble an actual client meeting in which you present your findings.
