    "### Stationarity\n",
    "\n",
    "The criteria for classifying a series as stationary indicate that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The mean of the series should not be a function of time, but rather should be a constant. The image below has the left-hand graph satisfying this condition, whereas the graph in red has a time-dependent mean.\n",

    "![](assets/Var_nonstationary.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The covariance of the `i`th term and the `(i + m)`th term should not be a function of time. In the following graph, you'll notice that the spread becomes closer as time increases. Hence, the covariance is not constant with time for the \"red series.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/Cov_nonstationary.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important? Many of the time series models work on the assumption that the time series is stationary. We can think of this as: If a time series has a particular behavior over time, there is a high probability that it will act similarly in the future. \n",
    "\n",
